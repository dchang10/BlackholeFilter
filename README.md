Blackhole Camera Filter

Made a blackhole filter for the BHI as a toy project. 
This filter takes an image and projects it onto the celestial sphere. 
The image is then lensed by a Schwarzschild blackhole and projected onto the screen of an observer at infinity.

The filter uses a fastlight approximation to calculate the lensed image. Maybe I'll add some slowlight dynamics in a later update.


Check out the filter on my [ghpage](dchang10.github.io/bhi-filter)

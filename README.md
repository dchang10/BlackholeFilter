Blackhole Camera Filter

Made a blackhole filter for the [BHI](https://bhi.fas.harvard.edu/) as a toy project. 
This filter takes an image and projects it onto the celestial sphere. 
The image is then lensed by a Schwarzschild blackhole and projected onto the screen of an observer at infinity.

The filter calculates the exact lensing structure one would see when looking at a blackhole, but emphasized by a factor of 10 to make the photon rings more apparent. Maybe I'll add some slowlight dynamics in a later update.
